# Final project for Compilers class exam
So it means this not a full time project nor do I plan to complete it.

## Summary
- Used compilers: Bison, Flex and Yacc.
- Bison version used: 3.7.6.
- Project made using WSL 1.
- Our raw input code is writed on the file **inputText.txt**.
- The translation from C language to Dart will be given from the terminal aswell as the graphic representation of the tree.
- You can acess the graphic representation of the tree on this website: [**Graphviz Online**][1] 

## How to use
- I've created a makefile as a shortcut for all the commands in order to compile this project. Open the terminal, go to the project folder and type **make**.
- The output of this compilation will be a file named **cmp**.
- Now type **./cmp inputText.txt**.
